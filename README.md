AWS Tech Session Recap - Amazon ECS (May 22, 2025)

# AWS Tech Session Recap – Amazon ECS

Welcome to the recap of our recent AWS Tech Sharing session focused on **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)**.

**👥 Audience:** Developers, QA Engineers, UI/UX Designers, DevOps & Cloud Engineers
**🎯 Topic:** Modernizing application deployment using containerized architecture with Amazon ECS

---

## 📌 1. Traditional vs Microservices Architecture

### 🏗️ Traditional Architecture

Applications are built as a single, tightly coupled unit where all components are deployed together.

### 🧩 Microservices Architecture

Applications are split into small, independent services that communicate via APIs and can be deployed individually.

* Each service can scale independently
* Enhances development speed and resilience
* One failure won't bring down the entire app

🛠️ Container technology is essential to achieving microservices at scale.

---

## 📦 2. What Is a Container or Image?

Containers package code, runtime, tools, and dependencies. They are built from read-only **images**.

### ✅ Benefits:

* Portable runtime application environment
* Single, immutable deployment artifact
* Support multiple versions with different dependencies
* Faster deployments
* Efficient resource utilization

## 🚀 3. What Does Amazon ECS Do?

Amazon ECS is a **fully managed container orchestration service** that lets you:

* Deploy, run, and manage containers
* Use either **EC2** or **Fargate** for compute
* Integrate with AWS services for monitoring, scaling, and security

---

## 🛠️ 4. Key Technical Concepts

### 🔹 Cluster

A logical grouping of services or tasks. With Fargate, infrastructure is abstracted.

### 🔹 Image & Container

Containers run from immutable images (stored in **ECR**) that include all necessary code and dependencies.

### 🔹 Task Definition

Blueprint for launching containers: image, CPU/memory, environment, ports, etc.

### 🔹 Task

A running instance of a task definition. It may consist of one or more containers.

### 🔹 Service

Ensures the desired number of tasks are always running. Auto-replaces unhealthy tasks.

## 🧠 5. Benefits of Using Amazon ECS

### ✅ Fully Managed

ECS handles the orchestration—no need to manage control plane components.

### ✅ Fargate Integration

* Serverless compute for containers
* No EC2 to manage
* Enhanced security and resource isolation

### ✅ Deep AWS Integrations

ECS connects natively with:

* Elastic Load Balancing
* CloudWatch Logs
* Secrets Manager
* Systems Manager
* CodeDeploy
* Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

---

## 💲 6. ECS Launch Type Options

### 🖥️ EC2 Launch Type

* Run ECS tasks on your managed EC2 fleet
* Full infrastructure control and visibility

### ☁️ Fargate Launch Type

* AWS-managed serverless infrastructure
* Focus only on task/container config
* Simplifies scaling and cost management

---

## 🔍 7. Common Use Cases

### 📊 Batch Processing

Plan, schedule, and run batch jobs using ECS with EC2/Fargate/Spot Instances.

### 🌐 Scalable Web Apps

Deploy scalable web services across multiple AZs with built-in HA and autoscaling.

### 🏭 Hybrid Deployments

Use **ECS Anywhere** for on-premise + cloud deployments with unified tooling and visibility.
